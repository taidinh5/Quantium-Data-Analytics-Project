# 🛒 Quantium Retail Analytics Job Simulation – Chips Category & Store Trial Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project is part of a **Quantium Retail Analytics Job Simulation** where I acted as a retail data analyst to help the **Category Manager for Chips** make data-driven decisions.  
The work was split into **two key tasks**:  

1. **Customer Segmentation & Purchasing Behaviour Analysis** – Understand chip-buying trends, identify customer segments, and provide strategic recommendations for the next half-year plan.  
2. **Store Trial Performance Evaluation** – Assess the impact of new trial store layouts compared to control stores and determine whether to roll out changes across all stores.

## 🔍 Task 1 – Customer Insights & Segmentation
**Objective:**  
Analyze transaction and customer data to uncover purchasing patterns, identify customer segments, and make commercial recommendations for the chips category.

**Key Steps:**
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
  - Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
  - Ensured consistent formats across datasets.
  - Merged transaction data with customer demographic data.
- **Feature Engineering**
  - Extracted **brand** and **pack size** from product names.
  - Created metrics such as **total sales**, **purchase frequency**, and **average spend per transaction**.
- **Analysis**
  - Segmented customers based on purchase behaviour and demographics.
  - Identified top-spending segments and high-sales periods.
  - Created visualizations to highlight trends (e.g., preferred pack sizes, brand loyalty, seasonal demand).
- **Insights**
  - Highlighted which customer groups drive the most revenue.

## 📊 Task 2 – Trial vs. Control Store Analysis
**Objective:**  
Evaluate the performance of new store layouts trialed in **Stores 77, 86, and 88** and decide if they should be rolled out.

**Key Steps:**
- **Control Store Selection**
  - Compared historical sales, customer counts, and transactions per customer.
  - Selected control stores with the closest match using **Pearson correlation** and **magnitude distance** metrics.
- **Performance Assessment**
  - Compared trial vs. control during the trial period.
  - Analyzed **total sales**, **number of customers**, and **transactions per customer**.
  - Conducted statistical significance testing.
- **Findings**
  - Identified whether increases in sales were due to **more customers** or **higher purchase frequency**.
  - Recommended which stores should adopt the new layout.
